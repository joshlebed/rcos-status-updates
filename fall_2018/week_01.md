## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Last Wednesday I met with my team and grad student Andrew Yale to learn about his work on Synthetic Data Vault and synthetic data generation in general. I then did some further research on neural networks and machine learning.

## This Week's Plan

> This week, I will fork my own branch of Andrew's repo and start messing around with it to gain a better understanding of the tools he is using.

> I will also work with my Dan to figure out what external libraries we should use, as well as how we will integrate the data generation tool with the Carme core.

## Anything Blocking?

> I have no external blockers to the work I intend to do this week.
