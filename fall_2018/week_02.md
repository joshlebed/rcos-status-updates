## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Last week, I forked Andrew's repo and started using some of the tools it provides. I also looked at the source code of some of those tools to understand how they are implemented.

> Dan, Mike, and I met up to study those tools and we started discussing how we are going to implement them in Carme.
