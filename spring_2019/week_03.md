## Last Week's Accomplishments

Last week, I didn't get much done - I was pretty busy with other work. I did read more articles about benefits and use cases of frameworks and database systems, which should inform our decisions as we design the architecture for LiveOut.

## This Week's Plan

This week, I will get one real frontend project done and put it on the repo.

## Anything Blocking?

No blockers this week
